## Post OP

This project is deisgned to help make your social media life easier. Post OP is designed to consolidate your primary social media accounts into one application. Post Op allows you to post to all your social media accounts at the same time.

## Motivation

This project was designed to save you, the user a bit of time. Instead of having multiple windows or applications open at the same time, Post OP allows you to send a status, tweet, and update at the same time, saving you time. The secondary motivation for Post Op was, we were requried to form a group and work on a project for our senior capstone class.
